* DESCRIPTIONS
** Public branches
*Council of Governors*: The central government. A senate composed of the heads
of each of the regional governments (if that's technologically feasible). Uses
magic to hold teleconferenced meetings so they don't have to leave their regions
all the time.

*Military advisors*: So called because they're technically just advisors to the
 Nine, who take active leadership in significant military campaigns and
 engagements.

*Regional militias*: Basically everyone is a member of the militia. The militia
 isn't called up unless there's some active threat to be dealt with, although in
 border areas a permanent guard of some sort is probably kept. Regional & local
 govts can call up the militia if necessary, but ultimately they're under the
 control of the military advisors & the Nine.

*Diplomats*: What it sounds like.

** Minor officials
*Priests*: See to the spiritual well-being of the people. Offer advice, act as
confessors. Act as minor auditors, looking out for unhappy, unproductive, or
disruptive persons. Also (along with educators) act as government recruiters.
Have ordinary jobs on the side, but priestly duties take precedence.

*Child-care & education*: What it sounds like; they bring up kids. A very
important division! Teachers, wet-nurses, and staff for the child-homes.
(Anything else?)

*Work-bosses*: Folks in charge of everyday jobs. "Boss" not always an accurate
term; sometimes more like a master-apprentice relationship. (TODO: special case
for farming?)

*Wardens*: Police/sheriff-equivalents. Have ordinary jobs on the side. (Are
these even necessary?)

** Secret branches
The existence of these services isn't secret, but their internal structure is.
The Auditors are the most public of them, the Monasteries most secret.

*Auditors*: The eyes, ears, and occasional hands of the Nine. Those who watch
 the watchmen. FBI cum Stasi cum Inquisition. Not as frightening as they sound.
 Their job is to watch for trouble brewing on the horizon, to find problems that
 aren't being solved adequately by local & regional governance, and report to
 the Nine. The Nine send orders down through the standard chain of command and
 the problem fixes itself. Usually. If it doesn't, or if a more discreet
 solution is necessary, then the Auditors take a more active role.

*Spies & agitators*: CIA. MI6. Foreign spies and provocateurs.

*Monasteries*: Where "deviants" (people who are "bad" in a way that doesn't
 imply disloyalty to Arhism, e.g. homosexuals) are sent to do useful (secret)
 work away from the rest of society. Researchers, test subjects, suicide
 commandos, secret missions, etc. etc.

* OPEN QUESTIONS
A lot of this would work more smoothly with magic. Do they incorporate magic
into governance? If so, who does the magic / makes the magic items? Do they have
a magic engineering corps?

Uses of magic:
- Fast communication up & down the chain of command

Do they have a regular engineering corps? How is massive engineering handled, if
at all?

Do they have a standing army? That seems infeasible, given the conditions. So
how does their military work?

How do the various branches recruit?
