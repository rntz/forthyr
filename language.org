* Notes
This languages is boring vowellically. Need to spice up vowel system.

It is too undefined consonontally. Need to settle on consonontal "feels" for
language as a whole, with regional variations.

* The Sikandan Syllabary
Actually an abjad.

Observations thus far:
- Syllables usually start with consonants
- Consonant-consonant pairs
- Word-ending consonants
- Vowel-sounds: ah oh ih uu eh

Ideas:
- Glottal stop as consonant

** Structure
Symbols for consonants. Marks added to consonant symbols (like diacritics) for
vowels. Marks can be left out to let the reader "infer" vowels, but this is an
archaicism. Modern text always includes vowel signs. (Additional ambiguity: not
all consonants are followed by vowels - can string consonants together with no
vowel between them.)

Dots usually used to separate words. Sentence endings went unmarked in old
texts; recently (past 100-150 years) have developed symbols indicating various
forms of pause. Still imperfectly standardized, and based on pause-length rather
than semantic meaning. There is a standard question-mark, though it is
sentence-initial rather than sentence-final.

** Vowels
|   | IPA |    | Examples of closest sound in English      |
|---+-----+----+-------------------------------------------|
| a | ɑ   | ah | dAkka fAther spA "just like my dear mAmA" |
| e | ɛ   | eh | dEbt bEst                                 |
| i | ɪ   | ih | wIn thIn                                  |
| o | o   | oh | approx: nO mOre fOr                       |
| u | ɯ   | uu | approx: pOOl dUde                         |

Vowels can be modified to end in r.
Vowels can be modified to diphthong from or to i (indicated by pre-/post-fix y).

Vowels can be modified to be nasalized (a la portuguese). This is a feature of
Lowlands dialect.

? Can be modified to diphthong to "ee" sound (fEEl)? ai ei ii(?) oi ui

agarwael

** Consonants
n t k th p f l w x h s y
tr kr thr pr fr sr

SR sometimes pronounced "sh"

*** On consonant clusters
Most consonant pairs represented by just concatenating consonant symbols w/ no
vowel marks. Since only some consonant pairs actually exist in Central
Forthyrian language, this over-represents. However, some consonant pairs require
single-symbol representation b/c one of the consonants in the pair does not have
its own symbol.

** Marks and their uses
Marks are used for:
- Vowels
- Indicating the vowel terminates with an "r"
- Distinguishing consonant voicings. Many consonant symbols have multiple
  voicings (eg. (t,d) (n,m) (k,g)). Some of these are functionally
  indistinguishable (not phonemically contrastive is the linguistic terminology
  iiuc) to most Forthyrian speakers (for example (t,d) (p,b)).

  However, (n,m) and (s,z) are distinguishable, and although their pronunciation
  is usually implicit, there is a mark that distinguishes them which is used
  occasionally, most commonly in proper names or borrowings.

** Representable words and names
Sikanda         Si Ka N Ta
Sikandarat      Si Ka N Tar Ha T
Sãngraha        Sa~ N KRa Ha
Forthyr         For Thir
Dhũl            Thu~ L          -- '~' is a mark meaning "nasalize". ignored/omitted by Heartlanders.
Himlas          Hi N La S
Pelluin         Pe L L Wi N

Macwelan        Ma K We La N    -- the M is an N-symbol with a marker
Fennimore       Fe Ni Mor       -- ditto
Zangma          Za N K Ma
Sang Maõ        Sa N K Ma Ho~

In "Za N K Ma", the Z is a marked S. The M is a marked N. The second marking is
not strictly necessary b/c (NKN --> "ŋm") in most dialects, but is usually added
for clarity b/c it's a proper name.

* Language
Need a name for it. Standard language of Central Forthyr, albeit it has many
dialects. Brought by the Church in order to unify the region? Or perhaps by
Sikanda. There are also some regional languages which exist in parallel with it.

** Allowable consonant clusters
Positions: i(nitial), m(edial), f(inal)

tl thl kl

nkr --> "ŋgr"
nkl --> "ŋkl"
nkn --> "ŋm"

** Pronounciation
Non-voiced vs. voiced generally not represented by different symbols. For
example, the pairs (t,d) (th,dh) (p,b) (f,v) (n,m) (k,g) (s,z) do not have
distinct symbols. Voicing is determined by dialect and surrounding context, and
maybe on a per-word basis?

Initial "h" is dropped in major dialect, which permits vowel-initial words (e.g.
Arhist = Har Hi ST, although "ST" is an inadmissible consonant pair and so
generally pronounced "sit").

nk  usually pronounced ŋk
h   pronounced as glottal stop in some dialects.
x   pronounced "zh" in some dialects?

Dialect split: in Lowlands dialect, n often transmutes to m.

** Pronouns
Many pronouns.

Two "we"s, one which includes the listener and another which excludes them.

There is a suffix which pluralizes any pronoun (a la japanese -tachi), but
usually plurality is left unspecified. However, there are special first-person
plural pronouns ("we"s).

There are special we/they/you pronouns for the clergy/church, and a special
third-person pronoun for deity/ies.

* Words
** Pronouns
Part is <person><plurality>. Person is {1,2,3}. Plurality is {s,p}. These refer
to the grammatical person and plurality, not the actual usage.

Many pronouns can be pluralized by suffixing with ???.
