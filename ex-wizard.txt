The realization that I no longer desired to be a wizard did not come suddenly. It floated into my waking mind like driftwood, borne on a tide of discontent that had been lapping at me so long I had almost forgotten what it is to be dry. But even a frog in a slowly heating pot of water will, counter to common supposition, leap out before he has boiled.

I found I no longer desired to be a wizard. This realization did not come suddenly; it beached itself gently on the shores of my awareness, driftwood flung on a tide of discontent that had lapped me so long I had forgotten what it was to be dry.

flotsam flung

-- so long I had become almost amphibian
-- almost forgotten how pleasant it is to have dry feet
-- did not come suddenly, like a lightning strike.
-- and thus gradually I became aware that the water had risen to my neck, and I was soon to drown.

So I left.

I left my master, my parents, my lover, my oath, and my name. I would like to pretend that leaving my lover was most difficult, but it was the oath-breaking that gave me pause. I still live in fear of that oath, though I have put seven years and uncounted leagues between us and not once seen a sign that I was being hunted, or that anyone suspected me for who I once was. Still it will catch up to me someday, in this life or another.

I did not leave my magic behind, though it may yet leave me. That is what at first I feared the broken oath would take from me, and I thought it a proper price to pay. No such luck; I am a mage yet, though that is not and never will be my occupation. I have been a beggar, a farm-hand, a soldier, a sailor, an honest merchant, a dishonest merchant, a looter of Ancient ruins, a bard, a beggar once more. Once, by no fault of my own, I was a hero.

Today, I am a thief. An incompetent thief, at that.
