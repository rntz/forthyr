### <span class="num">2</span> The Caste System

<!-- TODO: better phrasing for "varies from region to region". "not entirely consistent"? -->

The core of the caste system is the nearly-universal Four Castes, but they are merely the beginning of the many distinctions of rank and kind made by virtue of one's birth. But as these distinctions vary wildly from region to region, a description of the Four Castes will have to suffice.

<!-- TODO: I should really condense this into a few paragraphs if possible. Nobody wants to read pages and pages about the caste system. Caste inheritance DEFINITELY does not belong here, except to note that second & third sons of Nobles have a hard time. -->

#### <span class="num">2.1</span> The Four Castes

The Four Castes are Peasant, Warrior, Noble, and Priest. There are also various persons who fall temporarily or permanently outside of these castes, such as slaves and indentured servants, the newly-emerging merchant class, and infidelsâ€”followers of religions other than the Church of the Devout.

##### <span class="num">2.1.1</span> Peasants

The Peasant caste are the laborers and craftsmen who form the backbone of society: millers, carpenters, smiths, potters, weavers, miners, and such. I do not list farmers because almost all peasants are farmers, in addition to the other work they do. When the growing season comes, every able-bodied peasant is needed to tend the fields, farming as much land as possible so that the enclave has enough food to make it through Winter and still pay its taxes.

Peasants are bound to the land of their ruling Noble, but the strictness and enforcement of this bond varies. In the most populous regions, in particular the Lowlands, it is generally impractical to enforce. When it is enforced, usually it is by levying a fine on the runaway peasant's family.

Peasants are expected to take up arms during wartime, but they are not leaders in battle or in peacetime; that falls to the Warriors.

##### <span class="num">2.1.2</span> Warriors

Warriors are village chiefs and battle-leaders, trained swordsmen and scribes, minor officials and enforcers of the law. They generally receive tutoring from a Priest in reading, writing, culture and law. They are bound to the service of their Noble, rather than to the land. Generally a topside village has one or two Warrior families living in it.

Nobles also keep some Warriors in service at their court, as guards, scribes, messengers, courtiers, etc. Sometimes these positions are hereditary, and so entire families of Warriors serve the Noble, and sometimes Warriors are called up from among the villages to fill these positions. Courtly Warriors generally have higher social status than village Warriors.

##### <span class="num">2.1.3</span> Nobles

Nobles are the ruling class. Every Noble family has a *dominion*, a territory that belongs to them, along with the Peasants bound to it. 

<!-- TODO: barons vs kings -->

##### <span class="num">2.1.4</span> Priests

The Priesthood of the Church of the Devout.

#### <span class="num">2.2</span> The Merchant Class

In the Lowlands of the Pelluin river valley a new merchant class is beginning to emerge, rich enough to be able to flaunt the strictures of the caste system. The Church is of course outraged, and regularly petitions nominally-Devout kings to punish such violations; but their complaints nowadays fall largely on deaf ears. Over the past half-century the Lowland kings have learned that a hostile attitude to entrepreneurship will leave kingdom rather less prosperous than its more open-minded neighbors.

The reasons for this emergence I can only conjecture, but the relative mildness of the past hundred or so Winters in the Lowlands probably has something to do with it. A milder, shorter Winter means less time and effort spent merely surviving and more spent mining, smithing, crafting, and conquering. The Lowlands nations have become modestly rich as a result, and trade within and between nations is at an all-time high.

<!--
and the rulers whose states have grown rich from the merchants' trade are content to turn a blind eye to this violation.  -->

#### <span class="num">2.3</span> Sans-castes

A person outside the caste system is termed *sans-caste*. Sans-castes are generally treated poorly. A caste is a place in society; sans-castes have no place in, and receive no respect from, society. Merchants are a rare exception to this rule.

Slaves are of course sans-castes: they are property, not persons. Slave-ownership is rare, however: under the caste system strictly interpreted only a Noble may own property, and why would a Noble keep slaves when the caste system already enslaves an entire populace to their whims?

<!-- TODO: think about economics behind indentured servitude -->

Indentured servitude is far more common. Even a Peasant may have an indentured servant; indentured servants are not property, they are merely working off a debt they owe. The indentured are *temporarily* without caste; they return to their caste upon their release from servitude. As such they are better-treated than other sans-castes.

Infidels (i.e. non-Devout) are usually considered sans-caste, although some regions are more tolerant in this regard. How exactly they are treated depends on their religion or ethnic group. <!-- TODO: brief overview of how each group is treated? -->

Savvyheads nominally have caste due to their birth, but are practically treated as sans-caste. Without the patronage of a baron or king, savvyheads are doomed to being social pariahs, beggars and vagrants. And that's if they're lucky enough not to be lynched.

<!-- TODO: how are itinerants in general treated? adventurers are really just a special-case of this.

Classes of itinerants:
- adventurers
- minstrels and performers
- Travellers
- pilgrims (these aren't sans-caste, but temporarily have their caste revoked)

-->

Adventurers and treasure-hunters are <!-- TODO -->

Finally, there are outlaws. An outlaw has been stripped both of caste and protection under the law. Anyone may steal from them, kill them, or otherwise harm them without consequence. This punishment is generally reserved for heinous criminals who have repeatedly evaded capture.

<!-- Slaves, indentured servants, infidels, Seekers, savvyheads -->
