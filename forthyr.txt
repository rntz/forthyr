An Earther's Guide to the World
===============================

Where can I even begin?

I suppose I will start with the skies. On Earth, if you look up on a clear day, you see mere blue nothingness---and somewhere in it, the sun. But if instead you look up on a clear night, you see the whole universe before you. You Earthers are lucky that way: your sky is limitless, an opportunity without bound.

With us, it is almost the reverse. If you look up at night all you see is the moon, embedded in an empty black void. But if you are lucky enough look up on a clear and sunny day (rare as they are), you can see the whole world, rising away from you on all sides, with all its continents and archipelagos, its mountains and its oceans, its rough, hard dirt and its cool, enveloping waters.

There are no stars, no planets, no galaxies, no far-flung astronomic universe for us---just our world itself. We have known since first we had eyes to see that there was nowhere else to go.

If you are still confused, Earther, think of it this way: You live on the outside of a ball. We live on the inside of one.

If, more practically, you are wondering where the sun and the moon can be given that we live on the inside of a sphere, that is a question I can answer. There are four cardinal directions for us: Sunward, Moonward, North, and South. The Sun is situated

If at this point you find yourself objecting, if you find this landscape alien, then you are not alone. Your world is just as alien to me. If your objection is couched in the language of natural science, of physics and mathematics; if you wonder what force holds us to the inside of our ball as you cling to the outside of yours; then believe me, I do not know. Yet cling we do.

Perhaps you simply want answers to the obvious questions: What is outside the "ball" that we are on the inside of? What are the Sun and the Moon? Why do they brighten and dim at regular intervals? What causes the tides? The seasons? How did our world come to be? How did *we* come to be?

I have no answers for you. We do of course have myths and legends, as you once did, to explain our world, to demystify it and bring it down to a human scale. Before I came here, I even believed some of them. But I do not have time to explain our legends to you, and I will not spend more words explaining that I do not know how to explain things. If you must have an explanation, call it "magic"; for magic is a very real thing in our world. But that is a subject for another time.
