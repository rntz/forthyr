Temples to gods preserve ancient artifacts believed to relate to those gods.
Since the Ancients *were* the gods, this makes sense.

From an early age, it was clear that Blind Tom possessed extraordinary musical
gifts. He could imitate, either vocally or musically, any sound he heard. This,
coupled with an encyclopedic memory and all-encompassing passion for music,
meant that by the age of sixteen, he hovered somewhere between a respected
concert pianist and glorified sideshow freak.

Proskynesis: Exarchs (and some kings?) demand supplicants prostrate themselves
before them. This is one of the sticking points w/ the church, who believe
proskynesis is only appropriate when worshipping the gods (or venerated
ancestors).

"Each consonant has an inherent vowel which is usually short 'a' (in Bengali,
and Assamese, it is short 'ô' due to sound shifts). Other vowels are written by
adding to the character. A mark, known in Sanskrit as a virama/halant can be
used to indicate the absence of an inherent vowel."

Arhist world-view: "Zarathustra emphasized the freedom of the individual to
choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This
personal choice to accept aša or arta (the divine order), and shun druj
(ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda.
For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good
deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or increasing social justice) we increase this
divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine
order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the
Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make
a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and
ourselves."

DETERMINISM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet
Because of the element of luck in the game and the Egyptian belief in
determinism, it was believed that a successful player was under the protection
of the major gods of the national pantheon: Ra, Thoth, and sometimes Osiris.

Because the tagelmust is often dyed by pounding in dried indigo instead of the
normal process due to a lack of water, the dye often permanently leaches into
the skin of the wearer. As such the Tuareg are often referred to as the "blue
men of the desert".

----------
The medieval aristocratic household was not fixed to one location, but could be
more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates
scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all
their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a
regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the
marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the
lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.[27]

Particularly for kings, itineration was a vital part of governance, and in many
cases kings would rely on the hospitality of their subjects for maintenance
while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited;
there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire
royal administration.[28] It was only towards the end of the medieval period,
when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal,
became more permanently attached to one residence.[29]
