DETERMINISM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senet
Because of the element of luck in the game and the Egyptian belief in
determinism, it was believed that a successful player was under the protection
of the major gods of the national pantheon: Ra, Thoth, and sometimes Osiris.

Because the tagelmust is often dyed by pounding in dried indigo instead of the
normal process due to a lack of water, the dye often permanently leaches into
the skin of the wearer. As such the Tuareg are often referred to as the "blue
men of the desert".

The medieval aristocratic household was not fixed to one location, but could be
more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates
scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all
their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a
regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the
marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the
lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.[27]

Particularly for kings, itineration was a vital part of governance, and in many
cases kings would rely on the hospitality of their subjects for maintenance
while on the road. This could be a costly affair for the localities visited;
there was not only the large royal household to cater for, but also the entire
royal administration.[28] It was only towards the end of the medieval period,
when means of communication improved, that households, both noble and royal,
became more permanently attached to one residence.[29]
