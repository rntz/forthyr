## <span class="num">I</span> Skies

Where can I even begin?

I suppose I will begin with the skies. On Earth, if you look up on a clear day, you will see the sun suspended in a sea of mere blue nothingness. But if, instead, you look up on a clear night, you will see the whole universe before you. Earthers are lucky that way: your sky is limitless, an opportunity without bound.

With us, it is almost the reverse. If you look up at night all you see is the moon, embedded in an empty black void. But if you are lucky enough to look up on a clear and sunny day (for such days are rare), you can see the whole world, rising away from you on all sides, with all its continents and archipelagos, its mountains and its oceans, its rough, hard dirt and its cool, enveloping waters.

If you are confused, Earther, think of it this way: You live on the outside of a ball. We live on the inside of one. There are no stars, no planets, no galaxies, no far-flung astronomic universe for us—just our world itself. We have known since first we had eyes to see that there was nowhere else to go. We lack even the word for "Universe", a word so much more expansive than "world" or "Earth".

Our Sun and Moon do not hang distantly revolving in the sky; each sits in a definite place. The Sun caps our ball at one end, the Moon at the other, each sitting at the peak of a mountain ten times the height of Everest. "Mountain" is a poor word; at their peaks they are more like pillars. Together we call them the Eyes of the Gods. The lands surrounding the Eyes are permanently shrouded in clouds—that must be a strange place to live, if anyone does live there.

<!-- Eyes of God? Which God? are they themselves gods/goddesses? -->

Day begins when the Sun, lain dormant overnight, wakens to brighten the skies. It takes about two hours to reach full strength. Even then it is not as bright as your Sun, and it sheds a warm red-tinged hue—gentler to my eyes than your Sun's blinding white, but you might find the effect macabre. As day turns again to night, the Sun wanes and the Moon waxes. Unlike Earth's moon, ours does not change strength from day to day. Its light is a soft golden color, as bright as a full moon on Earth.

Our skies do not revolve as yours do, stars wheeling overhead every night; but neither are they entirely fixed. The direction of Moon and Sun never changes, but their distance, and thus their height in the sky, does. Forthyr, the continent from which I came, moves back and forth between them as the seasons change, but there is no easy pattern of connection to be discerned between the two. Sometimes the Sun is high in Winter; sometimes it is low. Other continents do the same, as can be seen by watching the sky. They move in a slow, endless, patternless dance, the only thing constant their orientation towards the Sun and the Moon.

<!-- Should Sun/Moon colors vary by season? But this would make season a *global* thing, not continent-specific. -->
<!-- Should there be an exception to "other continents do the same"? -->

From this constant we take our bearings. Our four cardinal directions are Sunward, Moonward, North, and South. One could as easily call the last two East and West, or Clockwise and Anticlockwise, or Fi and Fum; but if you think of the Sun as being in the East, where on Earth it rises, then you will grasp which direction North and South are relative to Sunwards and Moonwards.

That, in brief, is how our skies differ from yours; perhaps the briefest of all our differences.


## <span class="num">II</span> Seasons

There are three seasons on Forthyr: the monsoons, the dry season, and Winter.

The year begins when snow gives way to rain and the monsoons begin. Immediately the land is drenched by torrential, ceaseless rain. The air grows heavy with humidity and heat, especially in the lowlands. After the initial onslaught the rain lessens a shade, just barely enough for the soil to turn from impenetrable waist-deep mud into something dry enough to sow seed in. So begins the growing season—which is merely a name for the time when it is possible to grow crops topside. It is not one of the three seasons itself, but it is just as important as any of them.

<!-- TODO: Need to talk about life blossoming from the soil spontaneously, "trees" growing etc. OR could talk about that in flora and fauna section. -->

After the monsoons comes the dry season. The rains slowly taper off and the air grows hotter yet, a dry heat this time. The land parches and bakes, and one by one the rivers dry up. The growing season's end is traditionally marked when the nearest riverbed begins to crack in the heat. Only the mighty Pelluin remains flowing for the entire season. Halfway into the dry season, the dust storms begin. After that, travel topside is nearly impossible.

<!-- TODO: need sentence or phrase on effect of Pelluin's flowing on nearby cultivation and kingdoms etc. -->

<!-- TODO: fix "as if in knowledge" awkwardness -->

After the dry season comes Winter. The dust storms end, the heat fades, but the air stays dry as parchment. These are the dying days, as what little vegetation survived the dry season wilts as if in knowledge of what is to come. <!-- The animals go to ground, disappearing into wherever it is they spend winter --> Shortly the temperature falls below freezing and the snow begins. And it snows, and snows, and snows, and the snow piles up and does not melt until Winter is over. Nobody is quite sure how deep the snow gets; nobody and nothing survives Winter above ground.

During Winter we hide underground, like moles. We hide in the caves and tunnels that riddle the surface of this hollow ball we live in. We hide in the ruins of cities the Ancients built, we hide in natural caverns carved by underground rivers, and, if we must, we hide in cramped caves painstakingly hollowed out by shovel and pick, generation by generation. We live on grains and roots stored up during the growing season. We grow some food underground, fungi mostly, but not enough to live on; and you cannot make a good diet of fungi alone. Malnutrition is a serious problem in hard years.

Most years last about four hundred days. The monsoons last for a quarter of the year; the dry season, another quarter; cruel Winter takes the rest. But all of these are generalizations. A year can be four hundred days, yes, or three hundred, or two, or an unhappy five hundred. Sometimes the dry season comes early, and the crops are stunted; sometimes it arrives late, and Winter barely comes at all; and all too often Winter arrives on time, but doesn't leave when you expect it to.

If I make our world sound harsh, that is because it is. If I make our lives sound hard, they are. My friends and family, and those others I know who still live on Forthyr, would not say it is so; but that is only because they have nothing else to compare it to. <!-- So if my words sound bitter, it is because I am. -->

<!--
Forgive me if I make our world sound harsh, if I make our lives sound hard. Forgive me if I sound bitter. But our world is harsh, and our lives are hard. My friends and family, and all those many others I knew who still live in Forthyr, would not say it is so; but that is only because they have nothing else to compare it with. And that is why I am bitter.
-->

<!-- Two hundred day years, with barely enough time for the crops to grow, but so little winter that it hardly matters, are not unknown. A six-hundred-day year comes once in as many years, and leaves few survivors. -->

<!-- The monsoon and dry seasons generally last about a hundred days each; and Winter lasts as long as both combined. Half the year is Winter; the other half together is called Summer. -->

<!--

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Monsoon - Dust/Dry - Winter
year begins when winter becomes monsoon
Average year is 300 days, varies between 200-400 usually.

Long years require storing food and careful rationing; short years don't leave enough time for aboveground crops to grow before the season changes.

When are crops grown anyway? monsoon season, mostly, or as monsoon turns into dust season. maybe store up water from monsoon season to irrigate during dust season? use giant underground cisterns, like the Fremen in Dune?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

People do travel overground if they need to or if it's faster, but year-round settlements are always underground, to survive the winter. A site without underground connections is completely isolated during the winter. (However, also protected from gloom monsters? Or from attacks by other people? Unclear. Maybe no advantage to this at all.)

Nomads (mostly Orcs) in the Moonward Wastes migrate from winter strongholds to monsoon/dry season sites (different spots for monsoon & dry season? how does nomad agriculture work? or are they hunter-gatherers?)

---------- EXCISED PASSAGES ----------

The continent where I was born, Forthyr, lies about halfway between Sun and Moon. The shadows there lie long, no matter if it is night or day.

Our astronomers (another poor word, for they watch the sky, not the stars; they are also our cartographers and our weather-readers) tell us that the lands surrounding the Eyes are swathed constantly in clouds. It must be a strange place to live, if anyone does live there.

^ EDIT: remove astronomers sentence? it is plain to the eye that the moon is surrounded in clouds during the day.

-->


## <span class="num">III</span> The Ancient World

<!-- find a slightly more original way of putting this. or at least insert sentence about "why was the *old* civilisation advanced?" -->

Our world is strewn with the remains of an ancient civilisation, one clearly more advanced than our own, and indeed than yours. Most of our cities and enclaves are but repurposed Ancient ruins. Of the tunnels and caverns that riddle the surface of Forthyr, about half seem purposeful in a way suggestive of deliberate construction: rectangular rooms, human-sized doorways, razor-straight tunnels, geometric indentations carved into the ground or walls<!--, pillars spaced at regular intervals-->.

The Ancients built on a massive scale. Our largest cities occupy merely the upper levels of their ruins. They built tunnels wide enough for a hundred men or more to march abreast; and these same tunnels continue razor-straight so far into the distance they shrink to mere points. Above ground, too, they left their mark, in the form of vast bridges spanning mountains peak-to-peak; monolithic spires jutting a thousand paces into the air; dams that define entire ecologies; and of course, the Great Chasm that divides Central Forthyr in two, about which I will say more later.

They built using materials we do not know how to replicate. Having spent some time on Earth I can now guess at the identity of a few of them, but not all. Their constructions have withstood uncounted millenia unmarked by rust and uneroded by weather. To be fair, perhaps that is simply because those that could not stand the test of time no longer exist at all.

The Ancients left behind not only architecture, but artifacts. They left weaponry: guns, artillery, mobile weapon platforms (some tank-like, some humanoid, some monstrous), armored suits, glowing swords, death rays, psychic dampeners, hunter-seeker drones, city-destroying bombs, the whole shebang. They left infrastructure: power generators, light sources, plumbing systems, hydroponics chambers, teleporters, laboratories, factories. And they left thousands of other tools and gewgays: direction- and path-finders, lock-pickers, puzzles, jewelry, autonomous robots, toys, music-boxes; the list is endless.

Unfortunately, they forgot to leave behind any instruction manuals. The fact is, we have no idea what half of the stuff they left behind is even *supposed* to do, let alone how to operate it. Most Ancient gadgetry would simply sit abandoned in some king's treasure hoard—if it weren't for the savvyheads. I'll get to them shortly, but first, there is an Ancient device that demands more explanation than an entry in a list.

<!-- TODO: ^ ugh, awkward transition -->

<!--
But most of what they left behind, we simply do not understand the purpose of.
Even those things we do recognize, we rarely know how to operate. -->

<!--
We do not know the original purpose of half of what they left behind. Even those things whose purpose is obvious we rarely know how to operate. Consequently, blah blah disrepair blah.
-->

<!-- the entrances to the lower levels [of the ruins] are deliberately blocked off or guarded to avoid leaving a back-door for attackers-->

<!-- Then there are the boreholes, equally massive tunnels built straight down, for no purpose we can fathom. -->

<!-- should it be yellow or green? -->

<!-- Their favorite material, however, is a metal that yet remains a mystery: yellow, but paler and duller than gold, as strong as steel but impervious to rust, acid, and all the forces that wear -->

<!--

Points to make:

- Massive construction: giant cities, hundred-meter wide tunnels, boreholes, the Chasm.
  bridges between mountains, the bridge to the Desolate Isle, the Gap
  towers jutting thousands of meters into the air

- Strange materials: unrecognizable metals of unusual strength, plastics, etc.
- We don't know the purpose of half of what they built.
  eg. the Chasm, boreholes

- Some artifacts still functional even now
  Example artifacts:
  - Weapons: projectile, projected-energy, invisible death ray, slap-on disabling devices
  - Power generators, light sources
  - Hydroponics chambers
  - Immortality Machines
  - Devices and chambers of unknown purposes. No instruction manual.
  - Vehicles (?)
  - Locks

- Ruins usually thoroughly looted by now
  But often possible to find more

-->

<!-- There are other signs, too: the Chasm, boreholes, the Zothi Hill-Mazes. -->

<!-- TODO: why aren't these just the work of older generations of humans? what's ancient/superior about them? -->

<!-- built on the bones of some ancient bunker

No memory or record survives of the time when whoever or whatever created and used the

Apparently even the Ancients were not powerful enough to survive winter topside, however; all of their cities that we have encountered are underground. -->

### <span class="num">1</span> The Immortality Machines

Of all the technological relics left behind by the Ancients, without doubt the most significant are the Immortality Machines. I cannot tell you how to operate one, or even how one looks; I have never seen one personally. But I can tell you what they do: two persons go in, a master and a victim; the machine is activated; and the mind of the master walks out in the body of the victim. The master's old body is dead, and the victim's old mind is gone.

These machines are of course rare. They are beyond price: their value is measured in lost lives and ruined kingdoms. Society recognizes three kinds of people who possess and use Immortality Machines. The Exarchs are rulers who use the Machines to achieve undying sovereignty. The Arhist Elders are religious leaders who use the Machines—so they say—to preserve their wisdom for the good of humanity. Anyone neither a ruler nor an Elder, anyone else who, by secrecy, sorcery, or trickery, manages to possess and use a Immortality Machine, is called a Lich.

The Immortality Machines have shaped the history, religion, and politics of Forthyr since time beyond record. According to myth, their use was discovered by the First Exarch, Sikanda, at least four thousand years ago. Sikanda subsequently conquered the known world and ruled it for over a millenium before suddenly vanishing (often it is said they set sail across the Sunward sea). A legend of this form is nearly universal in Forthyr, so perhaps there is a grain of truth to it.

### <span class="num">2</span> Savvyheads

<!-- A very few people possess a unique and innate talent for working with Ancient devices. -->

Every once in a while, a person is born who displays from a young age a unique and innate talent for working with Ancient devices. Such persons are called savvyheads, and their talent comes with a curse: savvyheads are never quite of sound mind—or at least, not of normal mind. Their abilities are intuitive, rather than rational; they do not study to acquire them, and they cannot explain their techniques to others. Indeed, savvyheads find communication generally difficult, although the extent of this disability varies from mere difficulty putting things into words, to complete incoherency, to muteness.

Put simply, savvyheads are weird. Difficulty communicating is their only universal oddity. Other common traits include: physical and verbal tics; obsessive but pointless habits; childish behavior such as tantrums, pickiness about food, and the need for security blankets or dolls; and intense aversion to magic.
Savvyheads sometimes behave oddly toward artifacts they are investigating: caressing, smelling, or licking them, meditating or ritually preparing themselves before using them, etc.
They frequently have "deviant" sexuality: object, animal, and body part fetishes, sadism, masochism, or lack of any sexual attraction whatsoever. (Homo- and bi-sexuality, however, do not appear more common among savvyheads than the general populace, and neither does variant gender expression.)
Savvyheads who engage in artistic expression, though rare, produce surreal and disconcerting work, as if they see and experience a universe totally foreign to us.

<!-- TODO: when do their abilities manifest? their strangeness? what if identified as savvyheads early? what if never identified as savvyheads b/c never exposed to artifacts? -->

Savvyhead's utter strangeness is little-tolerated by society. Without the patronage of a baron or king, they are doomed to being social pariahs, beggars and vagrants—and that's if they're lucky enough not to be lynched. But they frequently receive such Noble protection, because their abilities are invaluable to those in positions of power and responbility. A savvyhead's skills can turn a moldy Ancient ruin fit only to be a Winter enclave into an artificially-lit city with running water, impenetrable defenses, and a vat-grown supply of nutritious food. Savvyheads are also a practical necessity for any Exarch who does not wish to spend decades studying the workings of the Immortality Machines.

And, of course, a savvyhead given access to Ancient weaponry can equip an army with enough firepower to overcome any force not similarly advantaged. This is a dangerous path to go down, however, for two reasons. Firstly, though a savvyhead may be able to repair and operate Ancient weaponry themselves, due to the intuitive nature of their ability and their general difficulty communicating, they cannot explain to others how to imitate them. To equip an army with Ancient weaponry, therefore, requires modifying the weaponry to operate by some means easily accessible to an ordinary soldier. This is only occasionally possible, and often renders the weaponry unreliable and unpredictable.

Secondly, making use of Ancient weaponry in battle has a tendency to alarm one's neighbors and cause them to make a common cause of defeating you. Even if you defeat them, you then have to worry about your neighbors' neighbors, et cetera.

<!-- Savvyheads often display other behavioral peculiarities, although difficulty communicating is the only universal trait. -->

<!-- Savvyheads also display peculiar behavior, in the form of quirks and tics, obsessive habits. -->

<!-- Note: savvyheads not any more likely to be homicidal, brutal, or psychopathic. Even the ones who enjoy sexual sadism. Indeed, generally easy to manipulate if their wants are met. -->

<!-- This problem is not merely verbal, either; they have equal difficulty understanding and communicating with body language, the written word, gestures and tones of voice. -->

<!-- TODO explain re savvyheads:

- start displaying behavior + abilities when approaching puberty
  (around age 10?)
- social outcasts (among Arhists, taken into special order)

-->
 


## <span class="num">IV</span> Peoples

The primary intelligent species of Forthyr are humans, dwarves, and the Traders. There are also orcs, kobolds, and a few other species of which I know little. Once there were goblins, but they have not been seen for three hundred years.

### <span class="num">1</span> Humans

I am human, and this guide is written from a human perspective. When I say "we" or "us" or "our", I speak of humanity, as it exists on Forthyr and other continents of our World. When I say "you" or "yours", I mean the humans of Earth. As far as can be determined, we and you are of the same species. This is somewhat surprising. It does, however, save me the trouble of explaining your own species to you.

<!-- TODO: explanation of ethnicities

I will note in passing that Forthyr is home to many ethnicities; save the pale barbarians of the Northern Wastes and the Travellers descended from them, most have skin in various shades of brown.
-->

<!-- TODO: para explaining why we don't live underground all year? -->

### <span class="num">2</span> Dwarves

Humans live underground when they have to. Dwarves live underground permanently, because they like it. They are masters of the depths and the dark; they are skilled in all manners of crafting and artifice, but above all in stone- and metal-work; they are strong, sturdy, and have both a taste and a tolerance for alcohol and other mind-altering substances; they are secretive, though not deceptive, and slow to trust non-Dwarves; and they have divined the operation of many Ancient artifacts, although they lack the intuitive genius of human savvyheads.

They are also short and bearded, in case you were wondering.

They are not, however, greedy for gold or jewels; neither are they of particularly warlike demeanor; nor are they honor-bound to a fault, save in the matter of Dwarven Secrets; they do not have a long-running feud with a race of elf-like beings, as indeed there are no such beings on Forthyr; and they certainly do not speak in a Scottish accent.

So much for Dwarven stereotypes.

<!-- TODO: how *do* dwarves interact with humans?

eg. if Dwarves trade, what do dwarves trade FOR? what do they value that humans can make?
well, they'll certainly trade for interesting Ancient tech. is that all?

IDEA: Tradition: dwarven rumspringa?
-->

<!-- The Dwarves live in cities and nations of their own, deep beneath Forthyr's surface. They rarely interact with humans, for they have little to gain from such interaction. -->

Despite Dwarves' fairly frequent contact with humans, surprisingly little is known aboutp them, apart from the common knowledge I give above. For example, it is not known how long Dwarves typically live; how and by whom they rule themselves; what or how they worship; or how their writing system works. <!-- more? -->
We have myths and folk-tales about all of these things, of course, but they vary inconsistently from region to region and teller to teller.

For another example, all Dwarves have beards and none appear to have breasts. It is not clear what, if anything, this means anything about their sex. The most common folk theory is that they are hermaphroditic. Dwarven corpses which have been examined have two holes, a front and a back, in their nether regions. A urethra and anus, apparently, but how to be sure? This suggests a species of  asexuals, which raises as many questions as it answers.

Dwarves have certainly been observed to form strong individual bonds, some of them so close and lasting as to appear marriages, but whether these are truly romantic relationships or merely companionate ones is anyone's guess.

The Dwarves themselves quite pointedly have nothing to say on the matter. It seems likely that it constitutes a Dwarven Secret. Indeed, according to legend, the only person to ever dissect a dwarf corpse, seeking to discover the truth of the matter, was murdered by Dwarves and then dissected himself—or, in the more gruesome version of the tale, vivisected.

#### <span class="num">2.1</span> Dwarven Secrets

It seems appropriate at this point to explain the matter of Dwarven Secrets.

<!-- FIXME: this is a joke -->

<center><strong style="font-family: Courier, monospace">[REDACTED]</strong></center>

### <span class="num">3</span> The Traders

<!-- They are called Traders because that is what they do, and it is only because they trade that we know anything about them at all. Otherwise their existence is entirely obscure, to humanity at least—if the Dwarves know anything about them, they're not telling. -->

The Traders are a mysterious folk, more secretive even than Dwarves. They are called Traders because that is the one thing that we know them to do. We do not even know if they need to sleep, eat, breathe, or excrete.

They swathe themselves from head to toe in bright-hued cloths. Their faces they cover with metal masks, no two alike, etched with spirals, whorls, and geometric patterns. Inset in their masks are glass eyepieces, usually tinted green or red or gold, which are opaque and mirrorlike from the outside. From where their mouths would be hangs a bag of a flexible black substance, pierced here and there with holes (for breathing, perhaps, although they make no sound). On their feet they wear large leather boots with pointed toes, and on their hands leather gloves with metal knuckles and fingertips. They are fond of decoration and jewelry, wearing gold-trimmed headscarves, tasseled shawls, bracelets and necklaces. They often wear decorated belts or silken sashes, hung heavy with pouches, trinkets and weaponry: swords, hooks, whips, and Ancient weapons of strange designs.

Beneath these clothes, they are covered in the same black substance their mouth-bags are made of. I now suspect this substance is rubber, or something like it; but rubber is not known to us on Forthyr. Not a scrap of Trader skin has ever been seen by human eyes—at least, not unless they have skin of rubber.

They trade for all manner of odd things, for religious relics and children's toys, for heirloom jewelry and story books, for Ancient artifacts and lotus flowers. Legend says they will trade for anything that someone holds dear. Above all, they trade for people. This does not earn them many friends; but they have a knack for getting what they want anyways, and their enemies always seem to end up dead, or missing.

<!-- Nobody knows what happens to the people they buy. They are rarely seen again, and those who do return are never of their original minds. -->

What do they give in return? Silk. Gold. Food. Tools. Weapons and armor. Spare parts for that Ancient machine that broke down ten days ago. Whatever the town they're in needs most. Many's the starving enclave that's been visited by the Traders with pallets full of grain, their asking price inevitably too high, at first—but the town's supplies dwindle and their crops stay dead and Winter is on the way, and they give in eventually, though the price has doubled in the meantime.

The Traders have no permanent abode that we know of. They travel in caravans, composed equally of Ancient vehicles and wraxen-pulled carts. Meeting a Trader caravan on the move is rare, however; when they visit a town, they seem to arrive out of thin air, and depart just as suddenly. Even if you manage to catch them leaving, trying to follow a Trader caravan is a sure recipe for getting oneself lost.

It is a mistake of legendary proportions to attack the Traders. They rarely stray from their caravans, which never camp inside city walls. They are almost always armed, and even when they do not seem armed, I would not be surprised to see a knife emerge from the deep folds of their clothing. According to the few stories of those unwise enough to attempt the deed, they are preternaturally fast, can shrug off heavy blows, and their rubbery "skin" is tough and resistant to edged weapons. Nonetheless,  individual Traders have been slain, and Trader caravans have been driven off (though not destroyed). Every such incident has been repaid, however, by a retaliatory strike of overwhelming force.

<!-- No Trader has ever been observed to use magic. -->

<!-- An Earther might say Traders look like Touaregs wearing gas masks and wetsuits. To me, Touaregs look like Traders with human faces and bodies. -->

<!-- You might say they look like Touaregs wearing gas masks and wetsuits. Of course, that is an Earthen way of seeing it. To me, Touaregs look like Traders with human faces and bodies. -->

### <span class="num">4</span> Other species

#### <span class="num">4.1</span> Orcs
I do not know much about orcs. They live on the other side of the Moon Mountains, where also dwell the Moonward tribes. To my knowledge they are much like humans in stature and intelligence, and much like the tribesfolk in technology and social structure. But they are said to be of a brawnier build than humans and have strange features (tusks, horns, a third eye; accounts differ). I have never met one; it is possible they are merely an unusual race of humans and the stories about them are exaggerations.

#### <span class="num">4.2</span> Kobolds

Clever creatures that live in Ancient ruins and lay traps for unwary treasure-hunters. They do this mostly to defend themselves, but also as an intellectual pastime. Successful raids on kobold strongholds have discovered meticulous records of each adventurer slain, how they died and who was responsible for the trap that got them. The kobolds, in other words, had been keeping score.

<!-- Kobold traps are particularly devious because they often incorporate ancient artifacts; kobolds have a savvyhead-like affinity for such devices. -->

<!-- Kobolds are also known for tinkering, savvyhead-like, with ancient artifacts, often incorporating them into traps. -->

<!-- Kobolds are also known for a savvyhead-like proficiency in tinkering with ancient artifacts, which often shows in their traps. -->

<!-- TODO: expand on kobolds -->

#### <span class="num">4.3</span> Goblins
The goblins were a peculiar race, extinct now for about three hundred years. The most common opinion of them today is that they were an enormous nuisance and they got what they deserved. They were by all accounts small, impulsive, aggressive, barely intelligent enough to carry on conversation, but possessed of a strange cunning, not unlike their more thoughtful cousins the kobolds.

<!-- talk about goblin kings? talk about dwarven-goblin hatred? -->

#### <span class="num">4.4</span> Others

There are many tales of other varieties of strange intelligent creatures, generally malevolent or treacherous, but few are attested by solid evidence. The University at Roke has an enormous skeleton, they say, that proves frost giants exist. Perhaps; or perhaps giants existed once and are extinct; or perhaps it is not a single skeleton at all, but a mere jumble of bones, some from humans and some from wraxen or mammoths.

There are regions of Forthyr so isolated, unexplored or impenetrable that strange intelligences could easily lurk in them all but unknown to the outside world: far within the Fungal Forest, or in the darkest depths of the Great Chasm, or beneath the Hill-Mazes of Zoth, or some lonely spot on the far side of the Desolate Isle. But most monster tales talk not of such exotic places, but of trolls lurking beneath bridges, or ratmen hiding in caverns just a secret passage away from the well-trodden tunnels of commerce; and it seems to me that if intelligent species were to be found in such pedestrian locations, we would surely know more of them than old wives' tales by now.

-->

### <span class="num">1</span> Villages, Enclaves and Cities

Good places to live underground are few and far between. You need a source of water, an aquifer or well. You need a space large enough for many people to live, and also enough to store the supplies of crop to last you through the winter, and seed to plant once it ends. You need a connection to the main network of underground tunnels that run beneath Forthyr. And of course, all this needs to be defensible.

Consequently, life underground is concentrated into sparsely scattered but individually crowded and cramped dwelling-places called *enclaves*. A single enclave usually holds from a hundred to a thousand people. Anything larger than that tends to become a city—the distinction being that enclaves are Winter refuges, while cities are inhabited year-round.

### <span class="num">2</span> The Caste System

<!-- TODO: better phrasing for "varies from region to region". "not entirely consistent"? -->

At the core of the caste system are the Four Castes: Peasant, Warrior, Noble, and Priest. These are merely the beginnings of the many distinctions of rank and kind made by virtue of one's birth; but as these distinctions vary wildly from region to region, I can give no brief account of them here.

The Peasant caste are the laborers and craftsmen who form the backbone of society: millers, carpenters, smiths, potters, weavers, miners, and such. Almost all peasants are farmers, in addition to their other work. When the growing season comes every able-bodied peasant is needed to tend the fields, to ensure that the enclave has enough food to make it through Winter and still pay its taxes. Peasants are bound to the land, and may not move freely without their Noble's permission.

Warriors are village chiefs and battle-leaders, trained swordsmen and scribes, minor officials and enforcers of the law. They generally receive tutoring from a Priest in reading, writing, culture and law. They are bound to the service of their Noble, rather than to the land. Generally a topside village has one or two Warrior families living in it. Nobles also keep some Warriors in service at their court, as guards, scribes, messengers, courtiers, etc. Courtly Warriors generally have higher social status than village Warriors.

Religion is a major force on Forthyr, more powerful by far than any king or exarch. The dominant religion is called the Church of the Devout, although it has not been unified under a single Church for a thousand years. For the last five hundred years its main competitor has been Arhism, a new religion—or perhaps merely a way of life, since it is godless—introduced by newcomers from across the ocean.

### <span class="num">1</span> The Church of the Devout

The Church of the Devout is a splintered, many-faceted thing. I here describe it as it exists in the Heartlands of Forthyr, the region I am most familiar with. Even so it is more a group of related religious traditions than a unified church.

The last time the Church of the Devout was united under one leadership, Forthyr trembled beneath the boots of its armies, and it very nearly exterminated the Exarchs and destroyed their Machines. That was a thousand years ago, during the Crusades. The Crusades failed, however, and the weakened Church was wracked by a Reformation led by a loose coalition of iconoclastic upstarts.

<!--
that left it splintered into many separate Devic Cults. In the Heartlands, moreover, these Cults absorbed and merged with various local animistic folk religions. -->

The failure of the Crusades split the Church along two axes. First, the initially successful Reformation soon splintered into many competing Devic Cults. Each Cult has its own priesthood and institutional structure, and worships its own deity—although acknowledging the existence and divinity of the others in the Pantheon. Second, in the Heartlands these Cults, seeking to gain converts, merged with various local animistic religions. This produced a split between the syncretic Low Church tradition, popular with common folk and incorporating the local religions' ancestor- and nature-worship, and a purer High Church tradition practiced by the nobility and upper priesthood.

Thus, if you ask the Cult priests what the essence of the Church is, they will speak of the Pantheon of the Devas, of how their particular god or goddess is foremost among them, and of the great histories and scriptures and the guidance they offer us. If you ask the peasantfolk, they will speak of nature spirits, of venerated ancestors, and of the rituals that ensure a long summer and a good harvest. But the true core of the Church is its attitude to reincarnation, belief in which is so universal and unquestioned, shared by Arhists and Seekers of the Way and even the Travellers in their own way, that it is considered beneath mention.

As a result, the Church is split along two axes. First, it is split into many competing Devic Cults. First, it is split into many competing Devic Cults, each with its own priesthood and institutional structure, each worshipping a particular god or goddess—although acknowledging the existence and divinity of the others in the Pantheon. Second, there is a distinction between High Church and Low Church; the former is the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced by nobility and upper priesthood, the latter those practiced by the commonfolk and local pastors.

There are two primary ways in which it is divided. First, it is split into many competing Devic Cults, each with its own priesthood and institutional structure, each worshipping a particular god or goddess—although acknowledging the existence and divinity of the others in the Pantheon. Second, there is a distinction between High Church and Low Church; the former is the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced by nobility and upper priesthood, the latter those practiced by the commonfolk and local pastors.

These divisions have their origins in the Crusades, a thousand years ago. The Church was united then, and Forthyr trembled beneath the boots of its armies. It very nearly exterminated the Exarchs and destroyed their Immortality Machines. But the Crusades failed, and the weakened Church was wracked by a Reformation that splintered it into separate Cults. In the Forthyrian Heartlands, moreover, these Cults absorbed and merged with various local animistic folk religions, producing the Low Church.

The Low Church, with its practices of ancestor worship and rites invoking natural spirits, has its origins in this absorption. -->

#### <span class="num">1.1</span> The Ladder of Reincarnation

Although almost all Forthyrian religions believe in reincarnation, they disagree on its significance and moral nature. The Church believes that when a person is reborn they are they are given a specific and immutable fate. This fate is determined by the person's *ka*, meaning roughly the state of one's soul. This fate in turn determines everything important about one's life: where, to whom, and into what caste one is born; how one shall die; one's personality and moral tendencies; one's profession or calling; and what one may hope to accomplish in the world.

Though our fates are decided at birth, it remains to us to decide whether to willingly fulfill our destiny to the fullest degree, or to senselessly fight and resist it, and so become a mere shadow of what we could have been. Deliberately following one's inevitable fate is noble and right; conversely, denying one's fate is both futile and reprehensible.

In particular, by following one's fate one acquires positive *ka*; resisting it generates negative *ka*. The greater one's *ka*, the more noble and desirable the fate of one's next life. Eventually, a person possessed of truly magnificent *ka* ascends into Heaven upon being reborn. Heaven is not, however, the end of the journey. There is great ladder of spiritual existence, on which our world is merely the middle rung. The realms of Heaven are the rungs above it, and those below it are of Hell.

The caste system is an integral part of this ladder of reincarnation. Everyone has an assigned place in the caste system, a role to serve in society. They have this role, they are in their caste, because their *ka* deserves it. If they live according to their place they are rewarded by just treatment in this life and a grander fate in the next.

This may sound unjust to your ears, Earther, but bear in mind that it is a source of immeasurable comfort to millions of people. The caste system merely codifies that which would most likely be the case anyways: the vast majority of people lead powerless, inconsequential lives toiling for a baron or king who cares little for them or their lot. They are subject to innumerable diseases, to the vagaries of the seasons, to the whims of their lord and the ambitions of their lord's enemies. Church doctrine does not serve only to castigate those who would exceed their place—it gives value and purpose to the lives of those for whom exceeding their place was never a real option to begin with. Such people are, sadly, in the majority.

#### <span class="num">1.3</span> The History of the Church

<!--  A thousand years ago, it was a unified Church worshipping a pantheon of major gods and goddesses and originating in the lands south of the Tall Mountains. -->

<!-- As the primary sources for the history of the Church of the Devout are the stories it chooses to tell about itself, it is hard to tell where myth turns into fact. According to Church dogma, the Church has existed for as long as humanity has. -->

I should warn you that the earlier parts of this history are educated guesswork verging on speculation. The Church is unfathomably ancient—Church dogma claims it has existed as long as humanity itself—and written records of any time before the Crusades are few and far between. Most sources on that period are from the Church's own internal histories, so who knows how accurate they are?

What seems likely is that, along with every other religion, the Church of the Devout was suppressed during the reign of the First Exarch Sikanda in favor of worship of Sikanda themself. It is perhaps from this source that the Church's lasting hatred for Exarchs and Immortality Machines springs.

<!-- TODO: work on next paragraph -->
<!-- scrabbled to grab a chunk of the rapidly disintegrating Empire -->

In the aftermath of Sikanda's disappearance, while a hundred upstart Exarchs scrabbled and squabbled over the fragments of the disintegrating Empire, condemning millions to die in war and famine, the Church re-emerged as a force to be reckoned with. The Church alone cared for the common folk. The Church re-established peace and rule of law, holding back the advances of avaricious warlords and rogue wizards. The Church unified people in an era plagued by darkness and dissolution.

So says the Church, anyways. <!-- And the Church indeed unified a great many territories. -->

<!--

### <span class="num">2</span> Arhism

The Arhists arrived in Forthyr by sea five hundred and fifty-odd years ago. They were for a few decades an itinerant people, selling their labor and preaching to any who would listen, until by chance a minor king liked what he heard, and adopted Arhism as his state religion. From this meagre foothold Arhism grew rapidly to become the second most powerful religion in central Forthyr. It converted significant portions of the Lowlands, established a minor presence in the Northern Heartlands, and outright conquered Sunward Himlas, now the center and capital of the Arhist religious empire. <!-- empire? conglomeration? federation? -->

<!-- TODO: noun for "the realm of Arhism", a la Christendom. Arhendom? -->

The Arhists do not believe in a god or gods. They believe instead in the principle of Arha, and its opposite, Kamma. Moreover they believe in their Elders, chief of whom are the Nine Immortals who govern Arhism. Arhism is not merely a set of beliefs but also an institution that propagates those beliefs and a system of government that enforces them; the three are inextricable.

Their full name is the *Strivers toward Arha*. The concept of Arha is difficult to convey, but combines in one word the concepts of life, progress, order, fairness, meritocracy, wisdom, and perfection. Kamma is conversely death, stagnation, chaos, arbitrariness, aristocracy, foolishness, and flaw. Arha is both the ideal world that the Strivers seek to bring about, and the ideal state of being for an individual. To the Arhists it is a driving principle behind nature and humanity; every person, every deed, every thought, every thing has some Arha in it and some Kamma.

The Arhists have a very different view of Immortality Machines than the Devout. Far from seeing them as evil, to the Arhists they are necessary. Those who are close to Arha, the Elders, must be rejuvenated through the Machine to preserve their wisdom, their perfection, their ability to bring us closer to Arha like them. Death is a servant of Kamma, ever seeking to destroy the progress we achieve in our lifetimes.

<!-- TODO: how do they see the sacrifices needed to run the Machines? -->

Unlike the Devout with their Saints and venerated ancestors, to an Arhist anyone of spiritual significance is either an Elder, one whose life is to be preserved forever by the Machines, or a Martyr, who would be an Elder but that their life was cut tragically short before they could achieve their full potential.

<!-- TODO: this view wins them appeal among kings seeking to become exarchs -->

#### <span class="num">2.1</span> The History of Arhism

The Arhists claim they made landfall in a gigantic Ark, somewhere on the far side of the Desolate Isle. Their histories say they fled from terrible persecution on a far continent. (If true, this is the only known instance of intercontinental travel.) They believed themselves to be the entire remaining population of Arhists—that their brethren at home had been utterly extirpated.

The Desolate Isle was then and remains uninhabited, save for the caves off the coast of Freeport; so the group did not make contact with any native Forthyrians. They occupied the Ancient ruin of Sangraha. A group of about fifty left, however, disobeying their elders' commands for fear that the island was too infertile and the remaining time too short to grow enough food to sustain them through Winter. They were right; fully two-thirds of those who remained perished in the coming Winter. For this reason Sangraha is known to Arhists as "The Martyred City".

The fifty who left found safe haven and passage to the mainland at Freeport. A small temple still stands there dedicated to their memory. Foresighted though they were, they are called the Unfaithful and considered cowards in official Arhist history.

Once Winter ended, the Unfaithful returned to find what had become of their brethren. They guided the few hundred survivors to Freeport, but it

### <span class="num">3</span> The Seekers of the Way

The Devout of the Church believe in living according to one's fated place, come good or ill. The Strivers toward Arha believe in fostering progress in society, bringing it closer to Arha. A Seeker of the Way cares not for fate or for progress, but seeks personal enlightenment above all else.

The Devout and the Strivers, for all their differences, both view the cycle of reincarnation as something like a ladder to be climbed, a path toward perfection so long it spans many lifetimes. To a Seeker of the Way, reincarnation is a distraction to be escaped, an illusion to be pierced.

The Devic Cults and Arhism both seek popular support and political power; for the past five hundred years they have struggled for dominance, sought to convert each other's believers and gain the ears of kings. The Way can barely be said to be an organized religion, and does not seek power or proselytize, though individual Seekers may seek power or followers for their own ends.

<!-- indeed, would-be Seekers are often hard-pressed to find a master to instruct them -->

The Way was founded six centuries ago by Otaumo, a former priest of the Cult of Tomas in the North-Moonward Heartlands. He "pierced the veil" and perceived the true nature of life and of reality during a visit to an abandoned enclave that had been overrun by a fungal bloom. Otaumo preached the insights he had gained, quietly and without fanfare, for the rest of his life. It is not known how or when he died.

Otaumo himself wrote nothing down, but his five foremost disciples each wrote chronicles of his life and explanations of their understanding of his philosophy. These books together form the Pentad, a core text for Seekers. The Seekers have few traditions, and foremost among them is this: every Seeker keeps a copy of the Pentad, with selected commentary from later eminent Seekers, and blank pages at the end for the Seeker to write their own thoughts.

<!-- Each lineage of the Way has its own particular selection of commentary, and many Seekers individually seek out further documents to include in their copy. -->

### <span class="num">4</span> The Tradition of the Travellers

The Travellers migrated into the Heartlands from out of the Northern Wastes, some eight hundred years ago. They have not mixed with the native Heartlanders, and preserve their own peculiar religion, culture, and language. They live in wandering bands, as their name suggests, and make their living as performers, tinkers, traders, doers of odd-jobs, and occasional treasure-hunters.

A group of Travellers is called a Cord. No two Cords are entirely alike; each has its own peculiar way of making decisions, its own traditions and stories, its own interpretation of their common religion. Usually, but not always, a Cord consists of several extended families. Almost all Cords are matriarchal, but they may be led by a single Cord Mother, or by a counsel of matriarchs; leadership may be inherited, or passed down by choice. Votes of all adult Cordmembers (or of all women Cordmembers, or of Cordmembers with children; the criteria vary) are often taken for important decisions, but some small Cords vote on almost all decisions.

Traveller culture values stories highly. Each Cord keeps its own library as well as maintaining an oral tradition. The Travellers believe a story is only truly alive so long as it has tellers. If they write down a story, they are committed to telling it again and again, or else they will have wasted parchment on a dead story. So they write down only the important stories, the ones they will always tell; and the less important stories are passed down by mouth.

The Travellers are vegetarians and pacifists, avoiding the use of force unless absolutely necessary. As they provide valuable services and entertainment, however, fighting with or taking advantage of Travellers is taboo among Heartlanders. This taboo is often justified via a superstition that claims the Travellers are protected by a magical Covenant that curses any who mistreat them. This taboo does not translate into personal respect or hospitality, however. Travellers dealing with Heartlanders are thus the objects of a unique mixture of eagerness and admiration for their tinkering and performing skills, fearful respect of their Covenant, and suspicion of them as outsiders and infidels.

<!-- Like the Northern Barbarians they are related to, they often have light-colored hair and eyes; subtler differences of facial structure also -->

#### <span class="num">4.1</span> The Shattered God

The Travellers believe in one universal God, who they call the One, who is immanent in everything; in some sense, the world *is* the One. All other Gods, they say, are but faces of the One.

### <span class="num">1</span> The Heartlands and Lowlands

<!-- TODO: describe how Heartlands are comparative bastion of Devout faith -->
<!-- TODO: more description of Heartlands and Lowlands independent of each other -->

Forthyr is a large continent; we know the shape it makes on the sky, but we do not know what sorts of peoples dwell at its far limits. By "we" I refer to the dwellers of the Heartlands, a region lying more or less at the center of Forthyr, and my homeland.

The Heartlands are mountainous, but well-populated, for the underground tunnel system is dense here and the land fertile. Only the Lowlands, which lie in the verdant valley of the great river Pelluin as it runs Sunwards to the sea, are more populous. The Heartlands and Lowlands are separated by the Great Chasm, a canyon so deep the bottom lies in permanent shadow. It is perhaps a kilometer wide. Its depth is unknown, and its bottom has never been reached. No river carved it, for it does not reach the sea; besides, it runs too straight and its walls are too sheer to have formed naturally. It is generally believed to be the relic of some Ancient disaster.

<!-- TODO: convey how bad going around either end of it is compared to the Gap
TODO: make the description of Pelluin waterfall convey scale better? -->

No human-made bridge spans the Chasm, and no tunnel runs under it. There are three ways past it: go around its North end in Himlas; go around its South end, in xenophobic Chengusa; or cross the Gap. The Gap lies at the center of the Chasm's North-South run. It is a pair of apparently natural stone bridges. One bridge runs between two underground tunnels on each side of the Chasm. The other carries the Pelluin from where it waterfalls over the Moonward side to an underground aqueduct on the Sunward side, from which it eventually springs forth onto the surface.

The Heartlands are bounded to Sunwards by the Chasm, and otherwise are ringed by mountain ranges: to the North, the Himlas Mountains; to the Moonward, the Moon Mountains; to the South, the Tall Mountains; and to the South-Sunwards the Short Mountains. It should be noted that the Short Mountains are "short" only in comparison with the Tall mountains; they are the Alps to the Tall Mountains' Himalayas.

### <span class="num">2</span> Himlas

Himlas lies North of the Heartlands, across the same-named mountains. It is a broad flat land, comparatively barren and sparsely inhabited, for the dry season begins early there. It is divided by a small mountain range, the Lorheins, into Sunward and Moonward Himlas. These were once united under the Torvil Dynasty, a religious empire with its own peculiar interpretation of the Church of the Devout. Sunward Himlas fell to the Arhists four hundred years ago. The remains of the Dynasty hold most of the smaller Moonward Himlas, clinging desperately to a century-old stalemate line. "Dynasty" is now a misnomer, as the country is ruled by regents since the last Torvil heir disappeared centuries ago.

### <span class="num">3</span> The Northern Wastes

Moonwards of Himlas, North-Moonwards of the Heartlands, are the Northern Wastes. They are more barren than Himlas, and permanently inhabited only by a few scattered tribes, but when the monsoons come the nomadic Northern Barbarians migrate into the Wastes, raiding the villagers and living off the land. Occasionally a particularly greedy barbarian warlord crosses the Horned Pass to attack the Heartlands, aiming to carve out a new kingdom. This rarely succeeds, but is always bloody.

The Wastes are bounded Sunward and Moonward by the sea, forming a wide isthmus. The barbarians, when they can be convinced to talk at all, tell of a grand empire beyond the Wastes, from which they are either exiles or emissaries. The Travellers, who came out of the Northern Wastes and share many of the barbarian's ethnic features, have similar histories (which they are similarly reluctant to tell to outsiders). <!-- TODO: more? -->

### <span class="num">4</span> The Tribelands

Beyond the Moon Mountains lie the Tribelands. <!-- TODO -->

### <span class="num">5</span> The Southern Kingdoms

Across the Tall Mountains are the Southern Kingdoms. The Tall Mountains live up to their name; moreover, there are not many underground passages through them. Consequently the Heartland and the Southern Kingdoms have little contact. The Southern Kingdoms are a bastion for the Church of the Devout, and were less affected by the Reformation than the Heartlands. <!-- They are rich in good (WHAT?) -->

### <span class="num">6</span> The Sunward Lands

South-Sunward across the Short Mountains is Chengusa, a large kingdom with intensely insular, xenophobic tendencies and relatively advanced technology. In particular, they possess primitive firearms. In spite of their xenophobia, they are rumoured to enjoy good relations with the Dwarves, which may explain where their technology comes from.

Sunward and a little South, crossing first the Chasm and then the Short Mountains, you will find the Zothian steppes, and beyond them Fennimore. I know little about the Zothi, and less about Fennimore. The steppe is completely separated underground from the rest of Forthyr; no tunnels run into it, save perhaps through the Hill-Mazes of Zoth, an  uncharted and unnavigable tangle of tunnels lying below the volcano Azilmur, at the tail-end of the Short Mountains.

At the Sunward edge of the Lowlands lies Gurth, oldest of kingdoms, ruled by Zangma (also called Satmak, or Engmar, or Sidmung, or Saõ Mong), an even older exarch. Zangma was old when the Crusades began; he even claims to have been a pupil of Sikanda, the First Exarch.

Lying between the Lowlands to the North-Moonward, Gurth to the North-Sunward, Zoth to the South-Moonward, and Fennimore to the South-Sunward, is Nobody Land. Although it is fertile and has a good climate, there are no underground caverns or tunnels in Nobody Land, nowhere to hide when Winter comes, and so nobody lives there.

#### <span class="num">6.1</span> Peχavn

South of Gurth, on a rocky peninsula jutting out into the Great Bay that separates it from Fennimore, is the small realm of Peχavn. The Exarch of Peχavn, who has no name she cares to divulge, is almost certainly the most powerful wizard of the past thousand years. Just off the coast of Peχavn is the legendary Wizards' Isle, of which everything is believed and nothing is known.

The Wizard of Peχavn has never lost a duel, and her forces have never been defeated in battle. Plots to destroy her Immortality Machine have been foiled before even being attempted, apparently without any of the conspirators leaking information. Plots to poison her typically end when the plotters die of their own poison. She is said to keep a flock of phoenixes on the Wizards' Isle whose continual burning keeps it in a perpetual Summer. Several centuries ago she mounted an expedition to reach the bottom of the Chasm. She alone returned; whether she succeeded or failed is known only to her.

When the Immortal Gengusra, one of the original Nine Immortals who arrived on the Arhist Ark, visited her court to attempt to convert her, he returned having himself become a Seeker of the Way. He was promptly slain by the Arhists, who consider him a martyr.

Among students at the University of Roke, the question of whether the Wizard of Peχavn could steal a Dwarven Secret and survive is roughly equivalent to the Earther dilemma regarding what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.

##### <span class="num">6.1.1</span> The spelling of &ldquo;Peχavn&rdquo;

"Peχavn" is strangely spelled, I realize. But it is the best rendering I can give of the name of her realm. It is pronounced "pe-CHAV-un", with "ch" sounding as in the Scottish "loch". I use the Greek letter Chi (χ) rather than "ch" or "x" to indicate that the name Peχavn as rendered in our writing contains a glyph not found in the Sikandan syllabary, which is the common script of central Forthyr. This glyph is similar but not identical to one in our syllabary, as Greek "χ" is to the Latin "x".

One may wonder why we use this glyph at all, if it occurs in only one name and has a ready substitute. We do not simply write "Pexavn" because there is, according to superstition, a curse on the name Peχavn that descends upon those who inscribe it incorrectly. This superstition is backed up by numerous tales of the fate of those who violated it, some of them quite recent. The reputed effects of the curse vary wildly. One recipient vomited up feces, then choked to death on them. Another found that wherever he travelled, the monsoons failed to fall; he was eventually hung by angry villagers. Another became irresistibly attractive to fungus hogs for the rest of his life.

Or perhaps you simply want answers, scientific or no, to the obvious questions: What is outside the "ball" that we are on the inside of? What are the Sun and the Moon made of? Why do they brighten and dim at regular intervals? What causes our seasons? Our tides? Our continents' movements? How did our world come to be? How did *we* come to be?

I have no answers for you. We do of course have myths and legends, as you once did, to explain our world, to demystify it and bring it down to a human scale. Before I came here, I even believed some of them. But I have not the time to explain our legends to you, and I will not spend more words explaining that I do not know how to explain things. If you must have an explanation, call it "magic"; for magic is a very real thing in our world—but that is a subject for another time.
